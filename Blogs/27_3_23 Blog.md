## 6/3/23: Title

### Overveiw

Last week I ended by saying that I would be prototyping this week, and see if it all fits together. This week however, I did not quite get that done, but I belive that all of the pieces can be put together properly

### Robotics progress


I could not print all of the pieces, but I did print all of the pieces that I improved to test if they work

The improved axel worked quite well, and I got the correct size for the motor without very much fiddling

I printed the toothed wheel, which printed well, but the centeral hole was too small and too round too fit the axel into, so it will have to be reprinted.

I also printed a circle that is the size of the hole which the ball goes into, to test if the model is the right scale.

This showed that the hole was slightly the wrong size, and can be changed.

### I also worked a little bit on the Hand

There is nothing more theraputic than going into Fusion 360 and making a cool thing. So I have been making a cool thing in Fusion 360. This has the added benifit of doing schoolwork that I can then add to my blog.

I reshaped the palm and worked a little on the joints, adding stoppers so that they cannot overextend past straight

### In Conclusion and plan for the next week

Hopfully by next weeks blog I will have at the very least prototyped all of the parts, if not a full model so then I can star working on the robotics and coding side.
