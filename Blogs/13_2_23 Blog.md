### Overveiw

Hiya Folks, Welcome back the Robotics Blog, where we sometimes do robotics

In this semester of Robotics I will be teaching myself how to make a robot that "Interacts with the real world", which means, it's time to make *something*. 

As it was the first week of school this week, I didn't really have a directive apart from that there will be a robot to build at some point, so I started working on it.

### Working on it

My initial idea is to build an "Omniwheel" that can move in many directions, and then put somthing on top of it later so I started modeling what such a thing would look like in Fusion 360, and came up with:

A case with a wheel for each cardinal direction which I can then put a ball into and have it move around.

The wheels then spin in their various directions, hopefully moving the ball in any direction I choose, or, at the very least, the four diagonal directions.
