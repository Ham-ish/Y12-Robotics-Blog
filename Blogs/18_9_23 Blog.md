## 18/9/23: Lots of Progress Today

### Overveiw

Last week I had lots of progress on my hand. This week I have less to write about because I spent the week writing my previous blog, however, i di have something to write about, which is a small improvement for the Wrist

### Small Improvement for the Wrist

I want to write a lot of words here so that it looks like i have lots of things to say. but nothing is in my silly little brain. 

### Plan for next week

I should be able to, if I can get all of the pieces printed, have a full physical build of the hand to present by next week or the week after that. other than that, it's the end of the term, which means the other subjects have too many assignments, making it even more difficult to do blogs.
