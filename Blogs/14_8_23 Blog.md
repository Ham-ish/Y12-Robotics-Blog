## 14/8/23: Hand Research and ICAW 

### Overveiw

3D printed the next prototype to find possible issues, did some research on the actual movement of hands and wrists, and encountered the very beginning of ICAW

### New Hand

I 3D printed the new prototype, at the wrong scale, so I have a very large hand to work with. I improved the previous design by adding a place for elastic string in the back so that the servo only pulls it down. All that together looks like this:
