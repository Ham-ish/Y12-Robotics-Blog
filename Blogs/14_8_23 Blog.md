## 14/8/23: Hand Research and ICAW 

### Overveiw

3D printed the next prototype to find possible issues, did some research on the actual movement of hands and wrists, and encountered the very beginning of ICAW

### New Hand

I 3D printed the new prototype, at the wrong scale, so I have a very large hand to work with. I improved the previous design by adding a place for elastic string in the back so that the servo only pulls it down. All that together looks like this:

</video>


Due to the scale being incorrect, the supports in the holes for the fishing wire for the second falange did not come out, so the servo is only pulling part of the finger, and the hole for the servo was the worng size so I had to hold it down, but the print works as a proof of concept. 

I also included an extra rotational axis for the thumb so that it is able to move more dynamically, but I currently dont have the ability to autonomously control it.

### Biomechanics of the hand

I did some research on the movement of the joints in the hand, and found way too many to control with my current design, but i found some helpful diagrams for hand movement

This is the movement of the fingers

Theses are wrist movements for the future, when a wrist maybe becomes a problem

This is perhaps an interesting design ideas. Or perhaps the hand is just a fascinating tool

### ICAW

ICAW (or In Class Assesment Week for the newly initiated) is rapidly approaching, which means I get to spend about an hour and a half writing an essay on why robots are Evil, or something. For this I will need to make a notes sheet on robot ethics. I will also be writing a practice essay on the topic during this week

### Plan for next week

Next week is going to be devoted to working on my five in-class assesments, so I will not be working on my project yery much, if at all, but I should have a notes sheet and possibly an essay to proudly present.
