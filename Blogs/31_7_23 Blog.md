### Overveiw

As last weeks blog post was my Project Development Document, this is the actual first Blog of the semester. Welcome back. 

My time this semester is mostly going to the Final Project, who's outline was in last weeks blog. 

### New Hand Project

So far I have made some plans and prototypes for what the hand should look like and how it should work.

To begin I designed a finger on the vaugest outline of a hand

<img src="../Images/Old Hand Full.png" width=400px alt="Hand Full">

<img src="../Images/Old Hand Angle.png" width=400px alt="Hand Angle">

<img src="../Images/Old Hand Thumb.png" width=400px alt="Hand Thumb">

<img src="../Images/Old Hand Hole.png" width=400px alt="Hole Through the Thumb for String">


The design would work by tightening one piece of string pulled through the holes, pulling the finger that direction

### In Conclusion and plan for the future
