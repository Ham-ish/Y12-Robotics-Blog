## 8/5/23: An excelent progress Blog

### Overveiw

Excelent progress for dome this week, started working on wireless connection.

The worries I had last week came to partial fruition, though it was not as dramatic as I though it would be, as far as my limited testing could tell.

### Project Domer

This is the prototype that I have so far. I dont have any housing for the electronics, nor any capacity to disconect it from my computer, I have solved some other problems.

This is the main robot body, the x and y axis motors are connected to the x and y axis of the motors.

These are the thing that makes my design work. They are the Motor Controllers and I am keeping them at arms length, becausr they are working now, and I don't want to nudge somthing and kill that.

Dispite my attempts to clean up the hellscape that is my current wiring setup with a breadboard, there is not much I can currently do, that is not going to involve restarting, which has the added benefit of approximately 17 million possible mistakes I could make.

This is what I plan to use to send the joystick data to wirelessly.

This setup is what I am using to try to understand how the dongles. It is not really working

If this video works I will be quite pleased. If it doesn't, what is happening, basically is that the robot is struggling across the table while the cables all hold it in a 5 centimeter area. thankfully the problem of the axies being a problem hasn't really got in the way 

### In Conclusion and plan for the future
