## 20/2/23: The Prototype

Last week I ended saying that I would Print my prototype and then see if I had any idea what I am talking about. I have now spent all week trying to get people to print the thing and have only gained access to the prototype on the morning of this blog post. I have now tested the idea and have some improvements that can be made

### Misadventures in printing

At first I thought that i could print it through the School 3D Printers as I have access to them most days, but it is week 4 and they havent even been turned on yet. So I had spent 3 days of wasted time there, then I asked around the people I knew if anyone else could print it, and got several answers in the affirmative, so I sent one the STL files and waited the several business I was warned it might take and then messaged them on the Thursday to ask if they were complete and they said that they hadn't started, but could start immidiatley and might be able to get it done before the weekend. Long sotry short I didn't get it before the weekend and spent an entire week fidling around and doing Diddly Squat

### But the Idea Works (Sort of) 

Connecting all of the wheels to axis in the bit I have called the "Hull" has partially succeeded and looks like this:

But the wheels are free spinning, because the hexagonal wheel joint (Which does fit very well on the wheel) does not fit into it's designated cranny

I have also made the entire design slightly too small for the ball that i was going to use as a "wheel" but i can fix that by finding or making a different ball

### In Conclusion and plan for the next week
