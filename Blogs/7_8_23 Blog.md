### Overveiw

3D printed the First prototype for the hand and then used the information I gained from that to redesign the hand in some major ways

### New Hand Project

Here is the fully Printed hand:

Through this I discovered several problems.

1 . Because of the placement of the holes for the fishing line, when I have an axle in the joint between the phalanges, the finger doesn't bend very far at all.

**Example**

2 . As I have two wires and no way to stop the finger, it is technically able to bend fully both ways.

**Fusion Example**

Although I noticed this problem before I printed and solved it.

3 . Biggest problem. As i have two wires connected to the same Servo, both have to be tensioned manually to have the finger work, so it is an incredible pain to put together.

I am thinking of solving these problems by moving away from hinged fingers and just having individual pieces, and instead of having two wires, one for each direction, I will just have one wire to pull the finger down, and then use elastic to pull it back up again.


### In Conclusion and plan for the future

I will work on my next design, and have a Fusion 360 Prototype, if not a physical prototype for my next blog. Other than that I may need to start thinking about what I am going to do about the In Class Assesment Week coming up soon.
