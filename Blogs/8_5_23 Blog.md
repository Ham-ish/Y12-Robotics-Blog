### Project Domer

Using the information I have gained from my previous prototypes, I have created a correctly scaled model so that it stops making crackling sounds.


It has occured to me that the 'Design' for the 'Dome' might have a fatal flaw.

Because the wheel that rotates the ball is not in the middle of the ball, but instead at almost a 45Â° angle, the wheel, if it is still, may stop rotation in any angle similar to the perpendicular angle. 

This might mean nothing at all, or it might mean that the robot will only be able to go in four diagonal directions, or it could mean that the current dome is futile. 



### In Conclusion and plan for the project
