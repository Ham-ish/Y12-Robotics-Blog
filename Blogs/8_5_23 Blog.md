## 8/5/23: A Potentially Problematic Blog

### Overveiw

Late blog thish week. update on more Doming

### Project Domer

Using the information I have gained from my previous prototypes, I have created a correctly scaled model so that it stops making crackling sounds.


It has occured to me that the 'Design' for the 'Dome' might have a debilitating flaw.

Because the wheel that rotates the ball is not in the middle of the ball, but instead at almost a 45Â° angle, the wheel, if it is still, may stop rotation in any angle similar to the perpendicular angle. 

This might mean nothing at all, or it might mean that the robot will only be able to go in four diagonal directions, or it could mean that the current dome is futile. 



### In Conclusion and plan for the future

Still need to print all of the pieces together to see if the problem is as problematic as I think it may be.

If the problem really is fatal, I will move to the, probably easier and more convinent to the project, Hand Thing.
