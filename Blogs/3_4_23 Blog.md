### Overveiw

In prepereration for the holidays, I did a buncha cool stuff. I printed and tested a finger of the Hand and some more Omniwheel and put together some of the robotics for the Omniwheel.

### Omniwheel progress

3D printed a scale centeral piece and tested the scale of other pieces compared to it

HEMISPHERE PIECE

Learning how motor controlers work. Sort of.

FULL CIRCUIT SO FAR

This mechanism uses an arduino to control two motor controllers based on the inputs of a joystick

Motor controllers are quite complicated. They take two binary inputs to control the direction of a H-bridge circuit and a variable input between 0 and 255 to control the speed of the motor spinning using PWM. 

Problems that I encountered:

All of the wheels I have printed are too big for the slots in the side of the hemisphere

I still have not got the axel to inner wheel ration correct

How they can be solved:




### I 3D printed the hand pieces

I printed three parts to create a finger as a proof of concept, to make sure that my design would even work at all.
