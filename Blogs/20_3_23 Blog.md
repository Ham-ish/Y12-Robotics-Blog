## 6/3/23: Everything went Well

### Overveiw

At the begining of the week I went over what I would be doing for the final project, and how it would tie into my research task. I came to the conclusion that I am going to make the omniwheel work for the first part, then later attach an articulating hand to the top of it. 

### Robotics progress

I implemented the improvments into my 3D model

### Cool Hand



### In Conclusion and plan for the next week
