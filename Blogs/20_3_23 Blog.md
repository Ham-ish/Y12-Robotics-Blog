## 6/3/23: Everything went Well

### Overveiw

At the begining of the week I went over what I would be doing for the final project, and how it would tie into my research task. I came to the conclusion that I am going to make the omniwheel work for the first part, then later attach an articulating hand to the top of it. 

### Robotics progress

I implemented the improvments into my 3D model I found last week by:


Adding teeth to the wheels for more holding

Modifying the axel so that it connects to the motor

Scaling the entire model up

And adding a hat so that the electronics have a place to go

### Cool Hand

I also started making designs for the cool hand idea

the idea is that the hand has fingers that are elastically pulled closed and then pulled open by a servo so that it can grab things. I have not made any prototypes yet

### In Conclusion and plan for the next week


3D print various tests for my desing and see if it all fits together

Do not assume that finishing an assignment will only take an hour or two, as i did that with my DT and ended up spending several days on it, which is why this post is several days late.
