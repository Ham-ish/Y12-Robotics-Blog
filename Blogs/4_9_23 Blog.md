## 4/9/23: Phingers

### Overveiw

I finally have some fingers that properly articulate. The problems that I need to solve now are getting the rest of the fingers on and getting the thumb to articulate properly. 

On the Tuesday after this blog is written, which is to say, tommorow for me, I begin AST proper, which is a terrifying thought, and part of the reason last weeks blog is a [Very Bad One]. 

### definite hand porgress

I printed the hand at the correct scale, but went through many mishaps in that area.

Here is a video of the fingers working:

The fingers now articulate based off of a potentiometer I have on a breadboard.

The next thing on my agenda is to: 

- Reprint the hand so there is somewhere to put the servos

- Attach all fingers to reprinted hand

- Attach thumb joint piece to strong enough servo and a bearing so that it moves

Once I get these things done I can work on other possibilities like:

- Wireless control

- control using flex sensors on a glove

### Plan for next week

Actually work

This week and lask weeks blogs have been a bit lacking, but once AST is finished it should be smooth sailing.
