# Robotics Blog 

## 1/5/23: The First Blog of the Term

### Overveiw

Debrief of any useful information over the last week of Term 1 and the first week of Term 2. 

### Project Introduced

Officially, the task is to choose a topic of intrest, research it thoroughly, implement the topic into a Mechatronic system in an interesting (But not necessarily useful) way, and then present your findings and your creation. It is suggested that you use the topic of the previous assignment, as you already have some understanding and research of it. 

However, I am already half-way through making a robot that is not based around any sort of topic. I have not made the robot in a way that easily connect it to any complex topic which brings me to the question:

"How is my project actually connected to the term project?"

My last topic of interest of Biomechanical Engineering does not have very much to with rotating orb, so I cannot use that, and the suggested topics do not mesh well with my design.

### I didn't really do much in the holidays

Mostly [Game Dev](https://ham-ish.github.io/Y12-Game-Dev-Blog/) work 

### In Conclusion and plan for the project

I will need to connect my current robot to a topic and research that topic. Then I will create a Presentation to present this. I have about 6 weeks to do this, so I need to schedule my time wisely.
