## 6/3/23: Big Exam Time

### Overveiw

Greetings Intrepid Audience, 
Over the weekend I was studying for exams and competing in a Cybersecurity capture the flag event, so I forgot to write the blog entrys for this week, but now I am writing this Blog right after finishing some exams, and my brain is currenly a bit empty. That is also why the posting of this blog is a little bit late.

### I have an exam on Tuesday

That means I need my knowledge of Biomechanical engineering on a piece of paper so that when my brain gets wiped by the secret exam police, I still have somthing to write about.

### In Conclusion and plan for the next week

This post is a little sloppy, but as I said before, Brain vacation. I hope that what I have on the notes sheet is enough for the exam, but the exam is open-laptop so I should be fine. All of this week is taken up by stuff, Exams, Athletics carnivals, English drafts. I do have two lessons at the end of the week to work on the robot though, so I will see what happens.

The point of the exam is mostly a regurgitation of knowledge and understanding, but I did learn more about biomechanical engineering, and the methodology of writing an extended response on a subject I enjoy
